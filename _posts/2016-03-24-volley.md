# Volley框架概述

## Volley总体设计图
![Volley总体设计图][1]

Volley的总体设计思路很清晰：主要通过两种不同的分发线程(CacheDispacher和NetworkDispatcher)不断的从请求队列(RequestQueue)中获取请求，这些请求都是继承于Request，可以自己根据实际需求进行定制，后面会提到；然后根据是否已缓存来调用Cache或Network两类数据获取接口之一，从内存或服务器获取到请求的数据，最后再由ResponseDelivery去做结果分发和回调处理。

## Volley的主要特点

主要从优点和缺点两个角度来阐述
优点：这里参考StackOverflow上的介绍
> 1.The networking part isn’t just for images. Volley is intended to be an integral part of your backend. For a fresh project based off of a simple REST service, this could be a big win.
2.NetworkImageView is more aggressive about request cleanup than Picasso, and more conservative in its GC usage patterns.
3.NetworkImageView relies exclusively on strong memory references, and cleans up all request data as soon as a new request is made for an ImageView, or as soon as that ImageView moves offscreen.
4.Performance. This post won’t evaluate this claim, but they’ve clearly taken some care to be judicious in their memory usage patterns. Volley also makes an effort to batch callbacks to the main thread to reduce context switching.
5.Volley apparently has futures, too. Check out RequestFuture if you’re interested.
6.If you’re dealing with high-resolution compressed images, Volley is the only solution here that works well.
7.Volley can be used with Okhttp (New ver of Okhttp supports NIO for better performance )
8.Volley plays nice with the Activity life cycle.

扩展性强。Volley大多是基于接口的设计，可配置性强
一定程度符合Http规范，包括返回ResponseCode(2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx)的处理，请求头的处理，缓存机制的支持等。并支持重试及优先级定义。
默认Android 2.3及以上基于HttpURLConnection，2.3以下基于HttpClient实现
提供简便的图片加载工具
缺点(存在的问题)：以下问题不支持，部分已解决
> 1. Multipart Requests (Solution: [https://github.com/vinaysshenoy/enhanced-volley][2]) 
> 2. status code 201 is taken as an error, Status code from 200 to 207 are successful responses now.(Fixed: https://github.com/Vinayrraj/CustomVolley)  Update: in latest release Google volley the 2XX Status codes bug is fixed now!
> 3. it's less documented but many of the people supporting this volley in github, java like documentation can be found here http://files.evancharlton.com/volley-docs/
> 4. To solve/change Redirect Policy of Volley Framework use Volley with OkHTTP (CommonsWare mentioned above)

Volley不适用于处理大文件的上传和下载，对此官方建议如下：
> Volley is not suitable for large download or streaming operations, since **Volley holds all responses in memory during parsing.**
For large download operations,consider using an alternative like DownloadManager.
